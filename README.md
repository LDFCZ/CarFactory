# CarFactory
Car Factory with using threadpools and Hibernate 

This project was created for the purpose of studying Threadpool . I also set myself the goal of learning how to work with databases using the Hibernate framework. This was not the purpose of the task, but I decided to do so in order to develop my personal skill. I used local database.

From the screenshots it can be seen that not all accessories, bodies and engines have the id of the car in which they are placed. This is due to the fact that these parts were left unused in storages.
